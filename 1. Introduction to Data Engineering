and ensure that data is accessible and useful for analysis, decision-making, and machine learning models.

Key responsibilities:
•	Build and maintain data pipelines.
•	Design and manage databases and data warehouses.
•	Ensure data is clean, reliable, and accessible for other teams (data analysts, data scientists, etc.).
•	Work with various tools and technologies (ETL frameworks, cloud platforms, databases).
