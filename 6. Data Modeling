What is a star schema, and how is it used in data warehousing?

Answer:
A star schema is a type of data modeling used in data warehousing, where a central fact table is connected to several dimension tables. 
The fact table contains quantitative data (e.g., sales revenue), while the dimension tables contain descriptive attributes (e.g., customer name, date, product).

The star schema is designed for efficient querying and reporting, where fact tables are typically denormalized, and dimension tables are often normalized. 
This design simplifies query performance and is commonly used in OLAP systems.
