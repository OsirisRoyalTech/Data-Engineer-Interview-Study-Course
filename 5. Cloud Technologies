What is the difference between AWS Redshift, Google BigQuery, and Azure Synapse?

Answer:
•	AWS Redshift: A fully managed data warehouse on AWS. It uses columnar storage for fast query performance and integrates well with other AWS services.
•	Google BigQuery: A serverless, highly scalable data warehouse that runs on Google Cloud. It uses Dremel for fast SQL queries and provides integration 
    with Google Cloud's AI and machine learning tools.
•	Azure Synapse: A cloud-based data integration service in Microsoft Azure, which combines big data and data warehousing capabilities. 
    It integrates well with Azure’s AI and machine learning services.

All three services allow for scalable data storage and high-performance querying, but they differ in their integration with the respective cloud provider's ecosystem.
