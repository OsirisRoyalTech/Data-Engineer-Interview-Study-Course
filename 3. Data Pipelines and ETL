What is ETL, and how is it different from ELT?

Answer:
•	ETL (Extract, Transform, Load): A process where data is first extracted from source systems, transformed (cleaned, enriched, or aggregated), and then 
  loaded into a target system (like a data warehouse).

•	ELT (Extract, Load, Transform): In this approach, data is first extracted and loaded into the target system, and then the transformation happens within 
  the target system itself, often using the computational power of data warehouses like BigQuery or Redshift.

ETL is commonly used when transformations are complex or require specific processing logic, while ELT is preferred for handling large volumes of data and 
when the transformation is relatively simple or can be done using the features of the target system.
