What is Data Lake, and how does it differ from a Data Warehouse?

Answer:
•	Data Lake: A centralized repository that stores raw, unprocessed data in its native format (structured, semi-structured, or unstructured). 
    It is designed for large-scale data storage and allows for complex processing, such as data exploration, machine learning, and deep learning.

•	Data Warehouse: A centralized repository of structured data that has been processed, cleaned, and transformed for analysis. It is optimized for querying and reporting, typically using OLAP techniques.
